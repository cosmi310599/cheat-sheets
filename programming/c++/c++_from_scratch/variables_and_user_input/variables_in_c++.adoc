= Variables in C++

Variables play a vital role in recording the state of a program at any given time, enabling the computer to suspend and resume execution seamlessly.

== Location of Variables
Variables exist in two realms:
* In the programmer's mind, represented symbolically (e.g., "depth of snow" or "customer‚Äôs bank account").
* In the computer's memory, referenced by numbers like `0xcafebabe`.

[NOTE]
====
The compiler aids by bridging the gap between symbolic names in code and their numeric representation in memory.
====

== Naming Conventions
C++ variable names:
* Must be constructed from letters (a-z, A-Z), and numbers (0-9).
* Are case-sensitive.
* Must begin with a letter.

Examples of valid variable names in C++:
----
int A;  
int a1; 
float alpha;  
string abc22;
double snowDepth;
double amountInCustomerAccount;
----
However, names like "Customer‚Äôs account balance" aren't allowed due to spaces and special characters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although C++ theoretically supports characters like ùù∞, many compilers and editors don't. Thus, sticking to conventional characters is advisable.
====

== Memory Allocation
C++ must work within the confines of a computer's memory:
* The smallest memory allocation is 1 byte (for a character variable).
* The maximum is bound by the specific computer architecture's memory capacity.

In the following lesson, we will delve into the specific ssyntax surrounding variables in C++.
