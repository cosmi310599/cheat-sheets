= Hello World Program

[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
----

NOTE: `return 0;` signals a smooth operation to the OS. By default, C++ returns 0 if no return at the end of `main`.

= C++ Structure

* C++ has a specific structure and grammar.
* Computer language grammar is simpler but stricter than spoken languages.
* Structure helps the computer understand the program.
* Important to understand both the structure (syntax) and the meaning (semantics) of a program.
* Detailed analysis provides insights into the program's structure and meaning.
