# Tag an image
docker tag IMAGE_NAME NEW_IMAGE_NAME:TAG

# Push an image to Docker Hub
docker push IMAGE_NAME

# Show container logs
docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID

# Execute a command inside a running container
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID COMMAND

# Create a Docker network
docker network create NETWORK_NAME

# Connect a container to a network
docker network connect NETWORK_NAME CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect NETWORK_NAME CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
----

- *docker build -t IMAGE_NAME PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE*: This command builds an image from a Dockerfile, which is a recipe for creating a container image. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name you want to give the image and `PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE` with the path to the Dockerfile.
- *docker tag IMAGE_NAME NEW_IMAGE_NAME:TAG*: This command creates a new tag for an existing image. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of the
